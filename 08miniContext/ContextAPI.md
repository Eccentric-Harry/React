# Context API (Library)

When using React, if a component is present within another component, we are bound to pass the reference to the parent components of the targeting Component. So this is not  an efficient way to manage Stage. We tend to waste time and memory. So we have intoduced ContextAPI to solve this issue. ContextAPI is only associated with React Js and Redux is Also associated with solving such porblem but it has a wider scope.

Library me Jyada Naming Convention problem nhi hota. But it is mandatory to follow specified conventions while dealing with Frameworks.
